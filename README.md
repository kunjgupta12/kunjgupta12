## 🔍 About Me

I’m a curious and impact-driven developer who loves building things that **solve real problems** – from farming apps powered by IoT and BLE, to CMS-driven web platforms and mobile-first healthcare tools.

With deep experience in **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and **AEM (Adobe Experience Manager)**, I bridge the gap between great design and clean, scalable code. I thrive on building apps that are as practical as they are performant.
